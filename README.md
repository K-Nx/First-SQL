# Analysis of Suspects
## Project Overview
The aim of the project was to build my knowledge of SQL Language and develop my understanding of queries.

I enjoyed creating the table and populating it with different bits of information.

I learnt how to use SELECT, FROM and WHERE to identify certain suspects.
